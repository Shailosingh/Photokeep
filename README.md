Picture this. You have tons of photos and memes you want to send to friends on Discord. However, you do not want hundreds of photos sitting on your drive, clogging up your system and taking up space. Or you don't want prying eyes seeing these photos on your system. You have tried to upload cloud storage to keep your photos but, that takes LOTS of money and no one wants to go to another service when they just wanna have a good time with their friends on Discord.

**Enter Photokeep!**

Photokeep is a Discord Bot that allows you to upload your photos and access them anywhere with only a simple command. Photokeep comes with the ability to organize your photos with folders for easy access and to minimize clutter. You can use these folders to make groups of related photos and use a simple command to take random or specific photos from these folders. You can even take a random photo from your entire collection. Whatever need you have, Photokeep is here to help.

Check out the companion website to view your folders and photos on the web.
